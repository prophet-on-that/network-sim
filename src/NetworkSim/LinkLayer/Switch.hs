-- | A single-interface switch, which identifies hardware addresses
-- with its ports to more efficiently forward frames. The port will be
-- learned as soon as a message is received from a host. Furthermore,
-- when a host disconnects and reconnects, the learned port will be
-- updated as soon as a new message is received.
